# CSC 370: Database Systems

_This is a course that introduces the relational data model and relational database management systems. This repository contains materials for the programming assignments used in this course._

**Note**: These assignments will *not* be used in Summer 2024. The course will now follow a [project-based learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project-based_learning) approach with a semester-long group project, similar to how _[Data Management on Modern Architectures](https://github.com/sean-chester/exploiting-modern-hardware)_ was run. This repository is thus not currently in use.
