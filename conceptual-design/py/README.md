# CSC370-202201 Assignment 2 Python Implementation

_This "starter" code provides the test harness for completing Assignment 2 in Python, which will be evaluated with the unittest Python module for unit testing. You should expand the test suite to ensure that your implementation passes not just the provided tests, but also other ones that could reasonably arise from the worksheets or lecture material. This repository is designed to facilitate test-driven development (TDD)._

## Build Instructions

This project uses Python3 and can be run in any environment that supports Python3 (e.g., command line interpreter or Jupyter Notebook). There are no specific build requirements; you can simply run the test suite by executing the main method in `tests.py`
```
python3 ./tests.py
```

## Dependencies

In order to run this code, you will need:

  * Python3 (for the ENUM library)

## Task

You should complete the implementation of the function `convert_to_table()` in `erd-converter.py`.
You are welcome to add anything you like to this file, which is the only one that you will submit. While you may modify any other files, e.g., by adding assert statements or additional test cases, these will not be part of your submission.

Because Python is a weakly-typed language, one sample instance of each class has been instantiated as documentation. You can also refer to the test cases and `__str__()` functions for additional documentation.

When we evaluate you `erd-converter`, we will swap out `tests.py` for a new file with an expanded set of twenty-two test cases, each worth 5% of the grade (for a maximum possible score of 110%). You can expect some test cases will be quite difficult, but none will involve obscene numbers of entity sets and/or relationships.
